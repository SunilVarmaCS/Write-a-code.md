# Write-a-code
How do we write a code


# IDE's -

We use IDE's (Integrated Development Environment) to write code.
- A Place to write, run, and debug code and also convert it to machine code.
- IDE's are like any other program on your computer except used for the facilitation of code.
Examples : (NetBeans, INteliJ, Visual Studio)

# IDE Functionality -

- In Addition to a place to write code, IDE's also include
- Built in Error - Checking
- For when code does not go right
- Auto Fill for frequently used words
- Project Hierarchy
A big step up from previously used methods of programming

# An IDE's Look -

Usually has a central are for writing code
- Additional windows, such as one for a console, project hierarchy, preview screens, etc.

How Do we write code : Using IDE's
Back to another Point, each language has its own set of rules you must follow within an IDE.
- You can't simply type rubbish in an IDE, Convert it to machine code and expect the computer to understand it. You need Syntax.

Learning Languages
Learning a computer language can be very similar to learning a real language
- All Programming languages have a set of rules you must follow when writing code in that language, just like in real language.
- In computer science it is called syntax.
- Similar to grammer in real life languages.

# What is Syntax ?

Suntax : Rules you must follow to a tee if you want your program to run correctly
- How you type out certain functions
- What you put at the end of each line of code.
How you set up certain functions.

Syntax for each programming languages is unique
Breaking programming rules will result in an error.

# Variable Example :

As an exmaple. Let's initialize a variable in Java, Python and JavaScript
- We haven't covered variables but basically they hold information.
- In each we have to follow different rules to complete the same task.

int variable = 3;
JAVA
- In Java, we must specify which type of variable we are defining, and add a semicolon at the end of the line

x = 3
Python
- In Python, we just type what we want to create

var x = 3
JavaScript
- In JavaScript, we specify we are making a variable, but don't define what type of variable

# Syntax Matters
- As you can see in just this simple example, syntax matters when learning a new language.
- The goal of the program was the same, but all three languages shown took different approaches.
